Making game via help of tutorial.
1)	Tutorial Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M7vX_z6B9I&list=PLBIb_auVtBwBkYGKni2wKHGVFP5b4pVwj
2)	I chose this tutorial for two reasons, actually I love these kinds of games and I enjoy playing it on my mobile phone, secondly I wanted to learn basics of using Unity as I have no previous experience using it, so it was good to start with a simple game.
3)	The hardest part was to add score and health and restart the game, because there was a problem with the font and I spent a lot of time searching in many other tutorials how to fix it.
4)	What I have learnt: 
•	How to make the basic movements of players and obstacles, and the background repetition
•	How to make to make the obstacles randomly attack
•	How to make player lose health when hits obstacles and how to reflect that by health count on screen
•	How to destroy game objects (destroy obstacle when hitten by player, destroy player when game is over)
•	How to make the game finishes and restarts again when pressing particular button
•	How to make score using collider and rigidbody, and increases the score when the player passes obstacles
•	How to make spirit animation
